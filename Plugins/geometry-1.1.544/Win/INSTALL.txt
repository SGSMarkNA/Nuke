* Further documentation and licensing information can be found in the 'docs' directory.
* Basic installation is accomplished by moving the top-level directory into one of Nuke's standard plugin paths:

OS X:    /Library/Application Support/Nuke/X.Y/plugins/
Linux:   /usr/local/Nuke/X.Y/plugins/
Windows: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Nuke\X.Y\plugins\

* Where X.Y is the major.minor version of Nuke installing for.
* So for Nuke 9.0 on OS X, the structure would look like this:

/Library/Application Support/Nuke/9.0/plugins/geometry-1.1.544
		geometry
		docs
		geometry
		icons
		init.py
		menu.py
		plug-ins
		PyPDF2
